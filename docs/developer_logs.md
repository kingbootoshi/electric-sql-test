# Developer Logs: ElectricSQL-Supabase Integration Fix

## Summary of Changes

We fixed sync issues between our Electron app, local SQLite database, and Supabase backend using ElectricSQL. The primary issue was our approach to data writes - we were incorrectly attempting to use a non-existent `/v1/write` endpoint in ElectricSQL rather than writing directly to Supabase.

## Technical Details

### 1. Core Architecture Changes

#### Previous (Broken) Architecture
- ✅ Read path: Supabase → ElectricSQL → Our Electron app (worked correctly)
- ❌ Write path: Our Electron app → ElectricSQL `/v1/write` endpoint (failed with 404 errors)

#### New (Fixed) Architecture
- ✅ Read path: Supabase → ElectricSQL → Our Electron app (unchanged)
- ✅ Write path: Our Electron app → Supabase API directly → ElectricSQL syncs back naturally

### 2. Implementation Changes

#### A. ElectricClient Improvements
- Removed `writeTodo()` method that attempted to use non-existent ElectricSQL endpoint
- Enhanced error handling in `syncTodos()` to properly distinguish between:
  - Network errors (true connectivity problems)
  - HTTP errors (endpoint-specific issues, not connectivity)
- Improved logging in `processShapeLogEntries()` with entry counts and detailed summaries
- Added better control message handling

#### B. Direct Supabase Integration
- Added Supabase API client initialization
- Implemented direct Supabase write operations in todos handlers:
  - Create: `supabase.from('todos').insert()`
  - Update: `supabase.from('todos').update().eq('id', id)`
  - Delete: `supabase.from('todos').delete().eq('id', id)`
- Added connection check before Supabase operations

#### C. Connection & Status Management
- Implemented separate tracking for ElectricSQL and Supabase connections
- App is considered "online" if either service is available:
  - ElectricSQL availability: Read sync functionality
  - Supabase availability: Write operations
- Implemented consecutive failure counting to avoid flapping between states
- Improved sync status reporting in UI

#### D. Offline Operations
- Updated pending operations processing to use Supabase API directly
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- Added operation success/failure reporting

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

- **Network vs. API Errors**: Now properly distinguish between:
  - Network connectivity errors (true offline state)
  - API-specific errors (endpoint issues, still online)
- **Detailed Logging**: Added structured, consistent logging with:
  - Operation tags (`[todos:add]`, `[syncWithSupabase]`, etc.)
  - Error types and contexts
  - Operation counts and summaries
- **Status Transitions**: Prevented incorrect offline transitions due to specific errors

### 4. Sync Process Improvements

- ElectricSQL used only for reading changes from Supabase
- Added detailed processing metrics (entries processed, skipped, etc.)
- Implemented better scheduling for periodic syncs
- Added sophisticated connection health metrics

## Technical Debt Addressed

1. **Architecture Mismatch**: Fixed the fundamental misunderstanding of ElectricSQL's role (read sync vs. write endpoint)
2. **Error Handling**: Properly categorized errors and avoided incorrect state transitions
3. **Logging**: Added structured, consistent logging throughout the sync process
4. **Code Organization**: Clearer separation of responsibilities between components

## Testing Notes

When testing the fixes, verify:

1. **Online Operations**: 
   - Add, toggle, delete todos while connected
   - Changes should appear in Supabase quickly
   - UI should update correctly

2. **Offline Operations**:
   - Disconnect network/stop Docker containers
   - Perform todo operations
   - Verify operations are stored in pending-operations.json
   - Reconnect and verify they sync correctly

3. **Initial Sync**: 
   - Clear local DB and sync state
   - Start app with existing Supabase data
   - Verify data appears correctly after initial sync

4. **Mixed Connectivity**:
   - Test with only Supabase available (writes work, reads don't sync new data)
   - Test with only ElectricSQL available (reads sync, writes queue for later)

## Future Improvements

1. Implement more robust conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
2. Add data validation layer before Supabase writes
3. Consider implementing retry strategies with exponential backoff
4. Add more detailed metrics and telemetry for sync health
